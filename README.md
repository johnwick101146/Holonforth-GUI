The Holonforth GUI systems are written in Tcl/Tk. Unfortunately there was no comparable Forth system available ten years ago. A development system that is present in all desktop operating systems (at least Windows, Linux and OS-X). That behaves the same everywhere and creates the same graphical user interfaces. A development system that is described in full detail in a present day book and behaves exactly as described. - Is there such Forth today? 

The systems are packed as multiplatform Tcl Starkits. Starkit applications include the full source text as scripts.

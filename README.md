### The Holonforth GUI systems are written in Tcl/Tk. 
Because ten years ago there was no comparable Forth system. A development system that is present in all desktop operating systems (at least Windows, Linux and OS-X). That behaves exactly the same everywhere and creates the same graphical user interfaces. A development system that is described in full detail in a present day book and behaves exactly as described. - Is there such Forth today? 

I present the systems here packed as multiplatform Tcl applications. The source of the Holonforth systems are included as clear source scripts in the Starkit applications. If you are familiar with Tcl you know how to access the files in the Starkit. Otherwise you probably wont enjoy them. Please refer to the Tcl literature.

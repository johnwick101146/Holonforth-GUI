The Holonforth GUI systems are written in Tcl/Tk - a great companion to Forth.

### Starpacks
The GUI executables are Tcl Starpacks ([Starkits](http://equi4.com/starkit/) with platform specific [Tclkits](http://equi4.com/tclkit/index.html)). They contain an autonomous Tcl interpreter and a virtual file system that hosts the application source scripts in the directory holon(t).vfs.
